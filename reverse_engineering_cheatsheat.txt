# 🧠 Reverse Engineering Tools — Beginner Notes by Eva

Welcome! This note is a simple guide to understand **reverse engineering tools** in a fun and easy way.  
These tools help you look inside software to learn how it works — just like opening up a toy to see what's inside! 🧸🔧

## 🗺️ Overview: What Is Reverse Engineering?

**Reverse engineering** means:
- Looking inside a program (like `.exe`) **without having the source code**
- Trying to understand how it works
- Used in cybersecurity, malware analysis, software cracking, etc.
